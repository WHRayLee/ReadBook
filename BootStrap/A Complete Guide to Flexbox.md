# A complete Guide to Flex
> 父元素（flex container）和子元素（flex items）

## Background
> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

> 弹性布局背后的主要想法是让容器有能力改变其项目的宽度/高度（和顺序），以最好地填充可用空间（主要是为了适应各种显示设备和屏幕尺寸）。一个灵活的容器可以扩展项目以填充可用的自由空间，也可以收缩项目以防止溢出。

> the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).

> 与常规布局（基于垂直方向的block和基于水平方向的inline）相比，flexbox布局是不分方向的。

## Basics and terminology
> Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”)
